# projectResume
This is a website created to help me better understand how websites, servers, clients, and networking works.
It will be used as a way to share my resume, and links to important social sites. 

The website is being run by express.js, a module built off of node.js which allows JavaScript to be used in back end development. I will be running the server on a cloud VM.
I'm considering learning how to use docker with it.
